# Slam bidding

I list suggested slam-seeking conventions here.

- Italian control bids, which promise 2nd round controls
- Non-serious 3NT
- RKCB 1430 for major suits and conventional kickbacks
  - For example, unusual 2NT-4♥♠ is RKCB in ♣♦ respectively
- Turbo 4NT for minor suits
- Control asking RKCB

# Legacy system notes

I used to collate my system notes in [BML].  It is a powerful tool for
typesetting multi-layered bidding structures.  However, I also yearn
interconnectivity in Markdown.  Markdown has hyperlinks.  I can break down my
systems into reusable chapters and then link them together.

The below are my legacy system notes built with BML.  I keep them here for now
because I have not yet fully covered them in this book.  I will eventually
remove them when the migration is complete.

# BTU 1NT

This bidding system has a strong notrump opening that does not contain a 5-card
major.  We use the BTU continuations after the 1NT opening: Stayman takes care
of invitation with 5+ spades.

## BTU QUANT scheme

BTU reuses 4♠ for QUANT.  This fills the blank that Gerber and Texas leave.
Standard QUANT usually invites the upper 1/2 to 2/3 of the opening range.  This
4♠ serves as a narrower QUANT than 4NT or 5NT by only inviting the top 1/3.

| 1NT-4NT | QUANT INV to 6NT |
|---------|------------------|
| 6NT     | S/O, 16--17 HCP  |

| 1NT-5NT | QUANT INV to 7NT |
|---------|------------------|
| 6NT     | S/O, 15 HCP      |
| 7NT     | S/O, 16--17 HCP  |

| 1NT-4♠   | F QUANT |
|----------|---------|
| 4NT      | 15--16 HCP
| 4NT-5NT! | F to a 5-card suit or 6NT
| 4NT-7♣!  | P/C to a 5-card suit or 7NT
| 6NT      | 17 HCP

## Discussion on bidding 5-5 majors

There are 3 ways to bid 5-5 majors in BTU 1NT: 3♥♠ and via transfers.  There is
more than one version in BTU.  I am demonstrating my recommendation here step by
step.

There are 4 levels of 5-5 majors: weak, invitational, choice of games, and slam
try.

- **Weak**: transfer to the better major and pass.  Give up on the other one.
- **Invitational**: anything goes except 3♠.
- **FG+**: anything goes.

Hands around the game level are prone to interference.  On the other hand,
leaking opener's shape can be helpful in slam bidding.  As a result, I
recommend the following bidding structure:

- **Invitational**: 3♥
- **Choice of games**: 3♠
- **Slam try**: 2♥ and then 3♥

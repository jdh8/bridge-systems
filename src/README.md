# Introduction

This book is a collection of my bidding systems.  I have been studying forcing
club systems since reading *Good, Better, Best* by Jan Eric Larsson, whose
simulations show that forcing club systems tend to outperform other systems.
I believe opening 1♣ for all strong hands is a superior treatment.

Strawberry Polish Club is a BTU-flavored Polish Club largely based on *Polish
Club 2020: Expert*.  Polish Club serves as a gateway to the world of forcing
clubs.  It is 5-card major.  Its main opening range is 12--17. Sharing these
properties, it has similar bidding structure to 2/1, the lingua franca of modern
bridge.

Blueberry Cottontail Club is a modernized mix of Blue Club and Cottontail Club
along with new ideas from BTU.  It is a 4-card major strong club system with a
moderately strong notrump.  It is highly experimental and subject to change
without notice.

## Hand evaluation

- **HCP**: the well-known Milton Work's 4321 count
- **Total points**: HCP + distribution points (void = 3, singleton = 2, doubleton
  = 1, subtract 1 for each short suit with HCP)
- **Zar**: 6-4-2-1 + Zar distribution points (a + b + a - d, where the
  letters are the number of cards from the longest to the shortest suit)
- [**Fifths**](https://bridge.thomasoandrews.com/valuations/cardvaluesfor3nt.html):
  4.0--2.8--1.8--1.0--0.4, adjusted HCP for notrump contracts especially 3NT
- **BUM-RAP**: 4.5--3--1.5--0.75--0.25, adjusted HCP for suit contracts
- **NLTC**: Count 1.5--1.0--0.5 losers for each missing AKQ

NLTC is a good single hand evaluator but not very additive.  It suits preemptive
initial actions but not for showing supports.  I wrote a [blog article][nltc] on
that topic.

### Stopper

I evaluate stopper quality as [GIB] does.

- **Partial stop**: length + HCP = 4
- **Likely stop**: length + HCP = 5
- **Stop**: A, QJx, or length + HCP at least 7
- **Two stops**: length + HCP at least 8

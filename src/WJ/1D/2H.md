# Flannery 2♥

Like [1♣-2♥](../1C/2H.md), 1♦-2♥ is Reverse Flannery.  It shows constructive
4+♥, 5+♠.

| 1♦-2♥ | CONST, 4+♥, 5+♠ |
|-------|-----------------|
| P, 2♠ | S/O
| 2NT!  | LEB
| 3♣!   | FG, 2+♠
| 3♦!   | FG, 3+♥
| 3♥    | INV, 4+♥
| 3♠    | INV, 3+♠
| 3NT   | S/O

[BTU Lyric][btu] + Lebensohl becomes even more useful after the 1♦ opening. When
opener wants to play 3m, they can have either long diamonds or a two suiter in
minor suits.  Responder assumes a 5-5 two suiter first, and then opener can pass
or correct.

# Competing at the 1-level

This part shares similarities with [the 1♣ opening](../1C/COMP_1.md).
There are also differences since 1♦ shows a long suit that allows further
preempts.

Like 1♣-(X), natural 1NT is not very useful after a double.  Transfer to clubs
instead.  Unlike 1♣-(X), there is no space for Transfer Walsh here.

| 1♦-(X)-  | - |
|----------|---|
| XX       | NF BAL G/T, 10+
| 1M       | F, 6+, 4+#
| 1NT!     | TRF, 6+, 5+♣
| 2♣!      | CONST+, 8+, 3+♦
| 2♦       | PRE, 0--7, 3+♦
| 2M       | PRE, 0--7, 6+#
| 2NT!     | TRF, PRE 7+♣ or FG 6+♣
| 3♣!      | INV+ TRF, 4+♦
| 3♦       | PRE, 0--7, 4+♦
| 3M!, 4♣! | SPL, 0--1#, 4+♦

When RHO bids a major suit, natural notrump from [Polish Club 2005][wj05]
right-sides the contract.  Spades below 3NT are transfer cuebids.  Hearts below
3NT show the unbid major.

# Competing at the 2-level

Major-oriented transfer system competes well with (1NT).

As clubs are directly under diamonds, bidding after 1♦-(2♣) is pretty natural.

| 1♦-(2♣)- | - |
|----------|---|
| X!       | T/O, INV+
| 2♦       | CONST, 3+♦
| 2M       | NF, 5+#
| 2NT      | NAT INV
| 3♣!      | INV+, 4+♦
| 3♦       | PRE, 4+♦
| 3M       | FG, usually 6+#

Competition with 1♦-(2M) models after [Rubinsohl](../../Rubinsohl.md) and
[1♦-(1M)](COMP_1.md).  Forcing raise 3♣ and preemptive raise 3♦ weaponize the
diamond fit.  Bidding 3♥+ resembles 1-level competition due to the natural 3♦.

| 1♦-(2M)- | - |
|----------|---|
| X!       | OPT, INV+
| 2♠       | NF, 5+♠
| 2NT!     | TRF, 5+♣
| 3♣!      | INV+, 4+♦
| 3♦       | PRE, 4+♦

# Natural 1♥

The major suit openings show 12--17 points and 5+ cards.  I separate them into
two chapters due to subtle differences in their continuations.

Responses to 1♥ are similar to natural 2/1 along with mixed fit-showing jumps.

| 1♥-  | 12--17, 5+♥ |
|------|-------------|
| 1♠   | F, 4+♠
| 1NT  | NF, usually 7--11, 0--3♠, 0--3♥
| 2♣♦  | NAT FG
| 2♥   | CONST, 3+♥
| 2♠!  | NF, 6+♠: CONST 3+♥ or INV 0--2♥
| 2NT! | FG, 4+♥
| 3♣♦! | CONST+, 5+#, 4+♥
| 3♥   | LIM, 4+♥
| 3♠!  | SPL, 0--1♠, 4+♥
| 3NT! | Choice of games, 12--15, 33(43)
| 4♣♦! | SPL, 0--1#, 4+♥
| 4♥!  | PRE, UNBAL 4+♥

## Plans to invite with spades

- The best invitations go through CB and jump to the 3-level, e.g. 63(xx), 54(xx)
- Balanced invitations go through CB and bid directly at the 2-level.
- Distributional mild invitations go to 2♠.

## 1♥-2♠

This jump shift tries to tackle hands hard to describe with BTU CB.  It shows
6+♠ with either extra values or a heart fit, but not both.  With both features,
1♥-1♠-1NT is the happy path since it ensures a double fit.

| 1♥-2♠ | NF, 6+♠ |
|-------|---------|
| 2NT!  | (R)
| 3♣    | MAX, 5+♣
| 3♦    | MAX, 5+♦
| 3♥!   | P/C, somewhat PRE
| 3♠!   | P/C, invite 3+♥
| 3NT!  | P/C to 4♥ with 3+♥
| 4♣!   | STR choice of games
| 4♦!   | PRE choice of games
| 4♥♠   | To play

## P-1♥

P-1♥ reduces to a fairly natural system.  We can keep using [Stenberg
2NT](1H/2NT.md) because it assigns minimum hands to 3♣.

| P-1♥ | 12--17, 5+♥ |
|------|-------------|
| 2♣♦  | INV, 5+#
| 2NT! | INV, 4+♥
| 3♥!  | CONST, 4+♥

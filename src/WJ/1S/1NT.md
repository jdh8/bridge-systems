# Forcing 1NT

Unpassed 1♠-1NT is forcing to accommodate strong invitations, especially 6+♥,
which is one step away from 4♥.

| 1♠-1NT | Usually 7--11, 0--3♠ |
|--------|----------------------|
| 2♣     | 4+♣ or BAL 12--14
| 2♦     | 4+♦
| 2♥     | 11--15, 4+♥
| 2♠     | 11--14, 6+♠
| 2NT    | 15--16, 5=♠, 2--3♥, 2--4♦, 2--4♣
| 3♣♦♥   | 15--16, 5+#
| 3♠     | 15--17, 6+♠

If you wish to invite with 4=♥, you are on the wrong path.  You should have
opened [Ekren 2♣](../2C.md) instead.

# Strawberry Ekren 2♣

Ekren is an artificial preempt showing 4+ cards in each major.  It is originally
at 2♦.  *Polish Club 2020: Expert* moves it to 2♣ to replace Precision 2♣ and
leaves space for Multi.

As invitational 54(xx) over-qualifies 1♠-1NT-2♥ but is insufficient for 1♣,
Ting-Yu Ye (TpKotoba) suggests that Ekren 2♣ incorporate these hands.  The
strong variant denies 5 hearts.  These hands are good for 1♥-1NT-2♠ or
1♠-1NT-3♥ in Polish Club.

| Variant | HCP    | Shape      |
|---------|--------|------------|
| PRE     | 4--10  | 4+♠, 4+♥   |
| STR     | 15--17 | 5--6♠, 4=♥ |

| 2♣-  | 4+♠, 4+♥ |
|------|----------|
| 2♦!  | (R), 8+, maybe any INV
| 2♥   | COMP, 2+♥
| 2♠   | COMP, 3+♠
| 2NT! | TRF, 6+♦
| 3♣   | NAT F
| 3♦   | NAT F
| 3♥♠  | COMP, 8--15, 4+#
| 4♣!  | STR choice of games
| 4♦!  | PRE choice of games

The 2♦ relay asks for distribution or parks any invitation.  The step for 6+♠ is
moved down to 2NT, so responder can still invite 4♥ with 3♥.

| 2♣-2♦ | (R), 8+ |
|-------|---------|
| 2♥    | PRE, 4--10, ♥ ≥ ♠
| 2♠    | PRE, 4--10, ♠ > ♥
| 2NT!  | PRE, 4--10, 6+♠
| 3♣!   | SPL, 7--10, 0--1♣, 5+♠, 5+♥
| 3♦!   | SPL, 7--10, 0--1♦, 5+♠, 5+♥
| 3♥    | PRE, 4--10, 6+♥
| 3♠    | FG, 15--17, 64(xx)
| 3NT   | FG, 15--17, 54(xx)

Opener's lowest rebids to 2♥ are reversed because 54(xx) needs more space.

| 2♣-2♥ | COMP, 2+♥ |
|-------|-----------|
| 2♠!   | STR, 15--17
| 2NT!  | PRE, 4--10, 6+♠, usually 4=♥

Opener immediately accepts diamond transfer with the strong variant.  This
agreement probably right-sides diamond contracts.

| 2♣-2NT | TRF, 6+♦ |
|--------|----------|
| 3♣!    | 4--10
| 3♦!    | 15--17

There are two kinds of choice of games:

- **4♣** by strength
- **4♦** by distribution

Such distinction helps judging how to react to interference.  Besides, 4♣ lets
the strong hand declare.  On the other hand, 4♦ closes the auction ASAP.

| 2♣-4♣ | STR choice of games |
|-------|---------------------|
| 4♦!   | TRF, ♥ ≥ ♠          |
| 4♥!   | TRF, ♠ > ♥          |

| 2♣-4♦ | PRE choice of games |

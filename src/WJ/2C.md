# Ekren 2♣

Ekren is an artificial preempt showing 4+ cards in each major.  It is originally
at 2♦.  *Polish Club 2020: Expert* moves it to 2♣ to replace Precision 2♣ and
leaves space for Multi.

As invitational 54(xx) over-qualifies 1♠-1NT-2♥ but is insufficient for 1♣,
Ting-Yu Ye (TpKotoba) suggests that Ekren 2♣ incorporate these hands.

| 2♣- | PRE, 4+♠, 4+♥ |
|-----|---------------|
| 2♦! | F, 8+, ask for the better major suit
| 2NT | NAT NF, 8--15, usually long ♦
| 3♣  | NAT F
| 3♦  | NAT F
| 3♥♠ | NF, 8+, 4+#
| 4♣! | STR choice of games
| 4♦! | PRE choice of games

| 2♣-2♦ | Ask for the better major |
|-------|--------------------------|
| 2♥    | ♥ ≥ ♠
| 2♠    | ♠ > ♥
| 2NT!  | FG, 15--17, 5--6♠, 4=♥
| 3♣!   | SPL, 7--10, 0--1♣, 5+♠, 5+♥
| 3♦!   | SPL, 7--10, 0--1♦, 5+♠, 5+♥
| 3♥    | 6+♥
| 3♠    | 6+♠

There are two kinds of choice of games:

- **4♣** by strength
- **4♦** by distribution

Such distinction helps judging how to react to interference.  Besides, 4♣ lets
the strong hand declare.  On the other hand, 4♦ closes the auction ASAP.

| 2♣-4♣ | STR choice of games |

| 4♥!   | TRF, ♠ > ♥          |

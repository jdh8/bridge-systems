# Competing at the 1-level

The design of the responses already bears competitive bidding in mind.  We
somehow ignore the meaning of overcalls to deal with artificial and psychic
bids.  We reorder major suit bids with Transfer Walsh to get a "support double"
by accepting the transfer.

## Over a double

We treat 1♣ as a weak notrump more than a club opening.  Club support is not
very effective.  We have a transfer scheme for all levels below 3NT.

- **1♦♥♠:** Transfer to the next strain. The low-level cuebid of 1♠ lets opener
  declare notrump.
- **From 2Q to 3♥:** A weak or strong transfer of 6+ cards.
- **3♠:** Transfer Gambling 3NT.

Natural 1NT is not very useful after a double.  Rebrand it as transfer.

| 1♣ (X) | - |
|--------|---|
| XX     | NF BAL G/T, 10+
| 1♦!    | TRF, 7+, 4+♥
| 1♥!    | TRF, 7+, 4+♠
| 1♠!    | TRF, 7+, 5+♣
| 1NT!   | TRF, 7+, 5+♦
| 2♣     | PRE, 0--9, 5+♣
| 2X     | PRE, 0--9, 6+#
| 2NT!   | TRF, PRE 7+♣ or FG 6+♣
| 3♣!    | TRF, PRE 7+♦ or FG 6+♦
| 3♦!    | TRF, PRE 7+♥ or FG 6+♥
| 3♥!    | TRF, PRE 7+♠ or FG 6+♠
| 3♠!    | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with no stopper outside
| 3NT!   | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with one stopper outside

## Over a suit

Bidding clubs here is more important than (X) because we often need to compete
to 3♣.

| 1♣ (1Y) | - |
|---------|---|
| X!      | TRF, 7+, 4+ next suit
| 1♥!     | TRF, 7+, 4+♠
| 1♠!     | TRF to 1NT, 8+, 0--3♠, 0--3♥
| 1NT     | NAT, 8--11
| 2X      | NF, 8--11, 5+#
| 2YZ!    | TRF, 6+ next suit
| 2♠!     | FG, ask for stopper
| 2NT     | NAT FG
| 3X      | INV, 6+#
| 3YZ     | INV+ TRF, 6+ next suit
| 3♠!     | FG, 6+♣

The whole bidding structure leans toward hearts over (1♠).  A well-known example
is the negative double.

| 1♣ (1♠) | - |
|---------|---|
| X!      | TRF, 7+, 4+♥
| 2♥      | NF, 5+♥, 7--11 or 6+♥
| 3♠!     | FG, 6+♥

## Transfer Walsh

Transfer to major suits has the same meaning as major suit responses to 1♣.
Opener usually bids as if responder had bid the suit naturally.  However, opener
has a new option: accept the transfer at 1M.  This option *steals* the support
double when advancer passes.

Here I only list support rebids for brevity.  The complete set of responses is
at [1♣-1M](../1C/1M.md).

Transfer Walsh in competition is also called Cachalot in French.

| 1♣ (1♦) X | 7+, 4+♥ |
|-----------|---------|
| 1♥        | SUPP, 12--17, 3=♥
| 2♦!       | FG, 3+♥
| 2♥        | MIN, 12--14, 4=♥
| 3♥        | INV, 15--17, 4+♥

| <div>1♣ (1♦) 1♥- or</div><div>1♣ (1♥) X-</div> | 7+, 4+♠ |
|:----|-------------------|
| 1♠  | SUPP, 12--17, 3=♠ |
| 2♦! | FG, 3+♠           |
| 2♠  | MIN, 12--14, 4=♠  |
| 3♠  | INV, 15--17, 4+♠  |

The cuebid is a useful tool to ask for stopper by ceding notrump declaration. I
decide to have a dual meaning 2♥, similar to 4SF.  It asks for a stopper by
default.  Rebidding the suit shows a natural suit.

| 1♣ (1♥) X | 7+, 4+♠ |
|-----------|---------|
| 2♥!       | INV+, ask for stopper.  FG, 5+♥
| 3♥!       | FG, 5+♦, 5+♣

## Direct and transfer to 1NT

| 1♣ (*) 1♠ | TRF to 1NT, 8+ |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1NT       | BAL MIN, 12--14

| 1♣ (*) 1♠NT | Direct and TRF to 1NT |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| 2♣          | MIN, 12--14, 6+♣
| 2♦!         | (R) INV+, ask for minor suit
| 2♥♠         | FG, 5+#
| 2NT         | BAL INV
| 3♣♦         | FG, 6+#

The 2♦ relay here is nothing more than 1♣-1NT-2♦.

| 1♣ (*) 1♠ - 2♦- | (R) INV+ |
|-----------------|----------|
| 2♥!             | 5--6♣
| 2♠!             | 5--6♦
| 2NT             | MIN, 2--4♦, 2--4♣
| 3♣!             | MAX, 2245
| 3♦!             | MAX, 2254
| 3♥!             | MAX, 6=♣
| 3♠!             | MAX, 6=♦
| 3NT             | MAX, 2--4♦, 2--4♣

When opponents bid a major suit, we gain another cuebid to ask for a
stopper.  It can also be a natural bid like 4SF.

| 1♣ (1M) 1♠NT | Direct and TRF to 1NT |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| 2M!          | INV+, ask for stopper.  FG, 5+#

## Responder passes

Responder is strictly limited, and 1♣ is prone to psychic bids.  Therefore,
there are some quirks about cuebids:

- Responder's cuebid (not to a X) is natural.
- Opener's cuebid after X is natural.
- Opener's 2NT is unusual because X includes 21+ "penalty".

| 1♣ (1Y) P | - |
|-----------|---|
| P         | 12--17
| X!        | 12--20, T/O.  21+, PEN
| 1Z        | 15--20, 4+#
| 1NT       | 18--20, usually likely stop
| 2♣        | 12--20, 5+♣
| 2X        | 20--23, usually 5+#
| 2Y!       | 21+, ask for stopper
| 2Z        | 20--23, 5+#
| 2NT!      | UNT, 18+, 5+ 5+ two lowest non-adverse suits
| 3♣, 3X    | 21--23, 6+#
| 3Y!       | Gambling, SOL 7+♣, ask for stopper
| 3Z        | 21--23, 7+#
| 3NT       | Gambling, SOL 7+♣ with stopper

# Competing at the 2-level

Competition at 1♣-(*) share properties of the following auctions:

- (*), as opener shows no suit yet
- 1NT-(*), as opener shows only strength

## 1♣-(1NT)

I recommend a transfer system below 3NT.  Since X frees up 2NT, 2NT and above
become transfers (cf. Rubens advances).  Below 2NT, continuations to
[1NT](../../1NT_BTU.md) form a major-oriented structure.  Such structure
allows bidding a 5-card major regardless of strength.

| 1♣-(1NT)- | - |
|-----------|---|
| X         | PEN, nearly BAL INV+
| 2♣!       | STAY. Garbage STAY. INV 5=♠
| 2♦!       | TRF, 5+♥
| 2♥!       | TRF, 5+♠
| 2♠!       | Minor suit Multi/STAY, 6+m or FG 4+♦ 4+♣
| 2NT!      | TRF, PRE 7+♣ or FG 6+♣
| 3♣!       | TRF, PRE 7+♦ or FG 6+♦
| 3♦!       | TRF, PRE 7+♥ or FG 6+♥
| 3♥!       | TRF, PRE 7+♠ or FG 6+♠
| 3♠!       | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with no stopper outside
| 3NT!      | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with one stopper outside

## 1♣-(2♣)

Similar to 1NT-(2♣︎), some 1♣︎-(2♣︎) show both major suits, e.g. Landy,
Michaels.  This kind of 2♣︎ requires extra care.  I recommend reverse unusual
vs. unusual.

| 1♣-(2♣)- | Both majors |
|----------|-------------|
| X        | PEN for either major
| 2♦       | NF, 5+♦
| 2♥!      | INV+, 5+♦
| 2♠!      | INV+, 5+♣
| 2NT!     | INV+, 4+♦, 5+♣
| 3♣♦      | NF, 6+#
| 3♥♠!     | Ask for stopper in this suit

Otherwise, keep using the major-oriented system at 1♣︎-(1NT).  This treatment
is the same as the *systems on* approach at 1NT-(2♣︎).

| 1♣-(2♣)- | Other cases |
|----------|-------------|
| X!       | INV+ STAY or INV 5=♠
| 2♦!      | TRF, 5+♥
| 2♥!      | TRF, 5+♠
| 2♠!      | Minor suit Multi/STAY, 6+m or FG 4+♦ 4+♣
| 2NT!     | TRF, PRE 7+♣ or FG 6+♣
| 3♣!      | TRF, PRE 7+♦ or FG 6+♦
| 3♦!      | TRF, PRE 7+♥ or FG 6+♥
| 3♥!      | TRF, PRE 7+♠ or FG 6+♠
| 3♠!      | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with no stopper outside
| 3NT!     | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with one stopper outside

# Non-forcing 1NT

Opener is free to pass 1♥-1NT with a balanced minimum.  The best major fit at
1♥-1NT-P is balanced 5-3.  Opener can judge when to pass quite safely.

The 2♣ rebid promises 3+♣ like Wbridge5 to ensure a safe courtesy raise.

| 1♥-1NT- | Usually 7--11, 0--3♠, 0--3♥ |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| 2♣      | NF, 3+♣                     |
| 2♦      | NF, 4+♦                     |
| 2♥      | MIN, 6+♥                    |
| 2♠      | MAX, 4+♠                    |
| 2NT     | BAL MAX                     |
| 3♣♦     | MAX, 5+#                    |
| 3♥      | MAX, 6+♥                    |
| 3♠      | MAX, 4+♠, 6+♥               |

## Impossible spades

As 1NT denies 4+♠, the 2♠ rebid must be artificial.  The **impossible 2♠** is a
forcing raise that is stronger than a courtesy raise.

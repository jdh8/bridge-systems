# Natural 1♦

This opening shows 4+♦ and usually 5+♦.  It gets more unbalanced as the strength
increases.

| Strength | Distribution |
|----------|--------------|
| 12--14   | 5+♦ or 4♦(441)
| 15--17   | UNBAL, 5+♦ or 4♦(441)
| 18--20   | UNBAL, 5+♦, 0--3♠, 0--3♥

Unlike *Polish Club 2020*, I use standard (i.e. non-inverted) minor raises along
with mixed raises to maximize preemption.  This method utilized the frequent 5th
diamond in the 1♦ opening.

Note that 1♦-2♣ is sometimes a phony suit.  It is the only way to bid a
game-forcing hand with long diamonds and no side major suit.

| 1♦- | 12--20, 5+♦ or 4♦(441) |

## P-1♦ { #P-1D }

Game forcing 2♣ becomes a natural invitation.  Consequently, 2♠ is a limit raise
because it no longer takes care of clubs.

| P-1♦- | 12--20, 5+♦ or 4♦(441) |
|-------|------------------------|
| 2♣    | INV, 5+♣, 0--3♠, 0--3♥ |
| 2♠!   | LIM, 3+♦               |

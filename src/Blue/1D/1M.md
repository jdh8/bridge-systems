## BTU 3-way checkback

We use BTU-style 3-way checkback to an XYZ auction.  There are 3 artificial
relays in the 3-way checkback:

- **2♣**: several variants:
  - to play 2X
  - strongly shaped invitation
  - balanced invitation or choice of games
- **2♦**: game-forcing checkback, usually a choice of games
- **2NT**: transfer to clubs

As a corollary, natural 2X are wide-range invitations and 3X become slam tries.

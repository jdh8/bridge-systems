# Weak 1NT

Blueberry Precision Club features a weak notrump that denies 4-card majors but
(43)33.  The responses are derived from [Terrorist's weak notrump][terr] by

| 1NT-    | BAL 11--13 |
|---------|------------|
| 2♣!     | NF STAY, INV or 6+m
| 2♦!     | PRE, 5+M
| 2M      | INV, 6+M
| 2NT!    | FG PUP STAY
| 3m      | INV, 6+#
| 3M      | PRE, usually 7+#
| 3NT, 4M | S/O
| 4♣!     | Gerber BW
| 4♦!     | Choice of games, 5+♠, 5+♥

Opener bids major suits [paradoxically][paradox] to 2♣♦ for safety.

| 1NT-2♣ | NF STAY |
|--------|---------|
| P      | MIN, 5--6♣
| 2♦!    | (R), 2--3♠, 2--3♥
| 2♥!    | 4333
| 2♠!    | 3433
| 2NT!   | 6=♦
| 3♣     | MAX, 6=♣

| 1NT-2♦ | PRE, 5+M |
|--------|----------|
| P      | 6+♦
| 2♥!    | (R)
| 2♠!    | 3433

I swapped 1NT-2NT-3♠ and -3NT compared to [Terrorist's 1NT][terr] for
consistency.

| 1NT-2NT | FG PUP STAY |
|---------|-------------|
| 3♣!     | (R)
| 3♦!     | 4333
| 3♥!     | 3433
| 3♠!     | 6=♦
| 3NT!    | 6=♣

## P-1NT

| P-1NT- | BAL 11--13 |
|--------|------------|
| 2M     | INV, 5--6#
| 2NT!   | PRE, 5+ 4+ minors
| 3M     | STR INV, 6+#

## Competitive bidding

I suggest a slightly constrained version of [Terrorist's runout][terr].

| 1NT (X) | Usually PEN |
|---------|-------------|
| P, XX   | NAT, to play
| 2♣!     | NF, 5+♣ or 4=M 4+♦
| 2♦!     | NF, 5+♦ or 4+♠ 4+♥
| 2M      | NF, 5+#
| 2NT!    | STR UNBAL
| 3X      | PRE

| 1NT (X) P | NAT |
|-----------|-----|
| XX!       | SOS, a long suit
| 2♣!       | 4+♣, 4+X

When 1NT (2♣) shows both major suits (e.g. Landy, Michaels), I recommend BTU vs
Unusual.

| 1NT (2♣) | Both majors |
|----------|-------------|
| X        | PEN for either major
| 2♦       | NF, 5+♦
| 2♥!      | FG, 5+♦
| 2♠!      | INV+, 5+♣
| 2NT!     | LEB, PRE 6+♣ or FG (xx)45
| 3♣♦      | INV, 6+#
| 3♥♠!     | Ask for stopper in this suit

Otherwise, keep the essence of major suit oriented bidding.

| 1NT (2♣) | Other cases |
|----------|-------------|
| X!       | OPT
| 2♦!      | NF T/O
| 2M       | COMP, 5+M
| 2NT!     | FG PUP STAY with stopper
| 3♣!      | FG PUP STAY without stopper
| 3♦!      | INV+ TRF, 5+♥, usually without stopper
| 3♥!      | INV+ TRF, 5+♠, usually without stopper
| 3♠!      | FG, 6+♦, ask for stopper
| 3NT, 4M  | S/O
| 4♣!      | Choice of games, 5+M, 5+♦
| 4♦!      | Choice of games, 5+♠, 5+♥

Flint 2♦ is essentially Multi.  Since opener cannot hold a long major suit, XX
simply asks for the held major suit.

| 1NT-2♦ (X) | - |
|------------|---|
| P          | 4+♦
| XX         | Ask for the major suit
| 2M         | P/C, usually 3+OM

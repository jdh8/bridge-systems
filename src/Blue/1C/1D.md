# Waiting 1♦

There have been many variants to unfold BAL 19+ at 1♣-1♦-1♥, such as Terrorist's
Moscito and Viking Precision.  All these variants successfully rescue the 2NT
opening from the notrump ladder, freeing 2NT up for preemptive uses.  However,
they tend to involve a cryptic relay structure at 1♣-1♦-1♥.  I believe that
1♣-1♦-1♥ becomes too crowded when 1♣-1♦ is too negative.

In Blueberry Club, 1♣-1♦ promises a suitable rebid to 1♥.  The weak and
relatively balanced hands go to 1♣-1♥.

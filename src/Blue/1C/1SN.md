# Positive major suits

Opener can always rebid naturally below 2NT.  Rebids of 2NT and above show both
extra strength and more specific distribution.

| 1♣-1♠ | FG, 5+♠ |
|-------|---------|
| 1NT   | 1--2♠, 2--4♥, 2--4♦, 2--4♣
| 2♣♦♥  | 5+#
| 2♠    | 3+♠
| 2NT   | 19--21, 1--2♠, 2--4♥, 2--4♦, 2--4♣
| 3♣♦♥  | 19+, 6+#
| 3♠    | 19+, 4+♠

| 1♣-1NT | FG, 5+♥ |
|--------|---------|
| 2♣♦    | 4+#
| 2♥     | 3+♥
| 2♠     | 5+♠
| 2NT    | 19--21, 1--2♥, 2--4♠, 2--4♦, 2--4♣
| 3♣♦    | 19+, 5+#
| 3♥     | 19+, 4+♥
| 3♠     | 19+, 6+♠

## Precedence

Slams prefer long fits.  Games prefer major suits.  To balance between these goals,
I suggest the following precedence for rebids:

1. 4-card support
2. 5-card new suit
3. 3-card support
4. notrump
5. 4-card new suit

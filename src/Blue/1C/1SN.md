# Positive major suits

Opener can always rebid naturally below 2NT.  Rebids of 2NT and above show both
extra strength and more specific distribution.

| 1♣-1♠ | FG, 5+♠ |
|-------|---------|
| 1NT   | (R)
| 2♣♦♥  | 5+#
| 2♠    | 3+♠, not 3444
| 2NT!  | 16--18, 5+♦, 5+♣
| 3♣!   | 16--18, 5+♥, 5+♣
| 3♦!   | 16--18, 5+♥, 5+♦

| 1♣-1NT | FG, 5+♥ |
|--------|---------|
| 2♣!    | (R)
| 2♦     | 5+♦
| 2♥     | 3+♥, not 4344
| 2♠     | 5+♠
| 2NT!   | 6+♣
| 3♣!    | 16--18, 5+♠, 5+♣
| 3♦!    | 16--18, 5+♠, 5+♦
| 3♥!    | 16--18, 5+♦, 5+♣

## Precedence

Slams prefer long fits.  Games prefer major suits.  To balance between these goals,
I suggest the following precedence for rebids:

1. 4-card support
2. 5-card new suit
3. 3-card support

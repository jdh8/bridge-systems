# Strong 1♣

Blueberry employs a novel approach to the strong club opening bid.  The 1♥
response is an immediate double negative.  This approach is well known for the
strong 2♣ opening in natural systems, but it is uncommon for strong 1♣ systems.
This pioneering method has two main goals:

1. 1♣-1♦-1♥ is forcing and accommodates steps on the notrump ladder.
2. 1♣-1♥ proposes playing 1♥, more powerful than playing 1♦.

The *cost* is that 1♦ is now forcing, the contract we seldom play even if
opponents ever let us.  The 1NT response also sporadically wrong-sides the
notrump contract.  I find slowly showing strong balanced hands OK since these
hands are slow in competition anyway.

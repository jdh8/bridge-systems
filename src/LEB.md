# Generalized Lebensohl

Lebensohl is a bidding convention aiming for competition at the 2-level.
Originally, for auctions such as 1NT-(2♦♥♠) and (2♦♥♠)-X, use 2NT and possibly
some steps above to convey conventional meanings.  I am generalizing onset
conditions as follows:

1. Partner has ever bid a non-pass.
2. Moreover, the last bid is (2♦♥♠) by either opponent.

## Rubinsohl for most cases

Rubinsohl is superior to standard Lebensohl in most cases.  Similar to Rubens
advances, the transfer structure helps saving bidding space.  Showing the suit
faster also helps competition.

| *-(2♦)- | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | OPT
| 2M      | NF NAT
| 2NT!    | TRF to 3♣
| 3♣!     | STAY
| 3♦!     | TRF to 3♥
| 3♥!     | TRF to 3♠
| 3♠!     | TRF to 3NT or 4♣

| *-(2♥)- | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | OPT
| 2♠      | NF NAT
| 2NT!    | TRF to 3♣
| 3♣!     | TRF to 3♦
| 3♦!     | STAY
| 3♥!     | TRF to 3♠
| 3♠!     | TRF to 3NT or 4♣

Swap 3♥♠ against (2♠) like [Larry Cohen][larryco] to avoid declaring hearts.

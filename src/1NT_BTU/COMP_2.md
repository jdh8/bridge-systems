## 1NT (2♣) { #1NT(2C) }

*Systems on* is a decent approach over 1NT (2♣︎).  The overcall is somewhat
ignored, and X replaces the stolen bid of 2♣.  Since continuations to 1NT is
major suit oriented, it is crucial if (2♣) shows a major suit.

### (2♣) shows both majors

This kind of 2♣︎ requires extra care.  I recommend BTU vs Unusual.

| 1NT (2♣) | Both majors |
|----------|-------------|
| X        | PEN for either major
| 2♦       | NF, 5+♦
| 2♥!      | FG, 5+♦
| 2♠!      | INV+, 5+♣
| 2NT!     | LEB, PRE 6+♣ or FG (xx)45
| 3♣♦      | INV, 6+#
| 3♥♠!     | Ask for stopper in this suit

### (2♣) specifies one major

This position is analogous to [(1M) 1NT](../Defense/1Y/1NT.md).  X replaces
the Gladiator 2♣.

### (2♣) specifies no major

Ignore the (2♣) overcall.  X replaces the Stayman 2♣ as usual.

# Multi 2♦

Multi 2♦ shows a 6-card weak two of either major.

| 2♦-  | PRE, 6+M |
|------|----------|
| 2M   | P/C
| 2NT! | INV+ (R)
| 3♣♦  | NAT F
| 3M   | P/C
| 3NT  | S/O
| 4♣!  | STR choice of games
| 4♦!  | PRE choice of games
| 4M   | S/O

| 2♦-2NT | INV+ |
|--------|------|
| 3♣!    | MAX, 6+♥
| 3♦!    | MAX, 6+♠
| 3♥     | MIN, 6+♥
| 3♠     | MIN, 6+♠

There are two kinds of choice of games:

- **4♣** by strength
- **4♦** by distribution

Such distinction helps judging how to react to interference.  Besides, 4♣ lets
the strong hand declare.  On the other hand, 4♦ closes the auction ASAP.

| 2♦-4♣- | STR choice of games |
|--------|---------------------|
| 4♦!    | TRF, 6+♥            |
| 4♥!    | TRF, 6+♠            |

| 2♦-4♦- | PRE choice of games |
|--------|---------------------|
| 4M     | To play, 6+#        |

## Suggested defense: [Multi vs Multi](https://chrisryall.net/bridge/multi-v-multi-2d.htm)


I regard Multi vs Multi as a specialized version of Unusual vs Unusual.  X
remains "penalizing" either suit but longer.  Cuebids are reordered and show
unbid (minor) suits.

| (2♦)- | PRE, 6+M |
|-------|----------|
| X!    | OPT, 12+ and 5+M, or BAL 19+
| 2♥!   | BAL, 16--18
| 2♠!   | TRF, 14+, 5+♣
| 2NT!  | TRF, 14+, 5+♦
| 3♣    | NAT, 8--13, 6+♣
| 3♦    | NAT, 8--13, 6+♦
| 3M!   | NF Michaels, 5+#, usually 5+m

We frequently pass 2♦x with 4+ diamonds to ease slam exploration, especially
for minor suit slams.

| (2♦)-X- | OPT, 12+ and 5+M, or BAL 19+ |
|---------|------------------------------|
| 2M!     | P/C
| 2NT!    | INV+, REV LEB
| 3♣      | PRE, usually 5+♣
| 3♦!     | INV+ TRF, 5+♥
| 3♥!     | INV+ TRF, 5+♠
| 3♠!     | FG TRF, usually 6+♣
| 3NT     | To play
| 4♣!     | STR choice of games
| 4♦!     | PRE choice of games

| (2♦)-X-2NT | REV LEB |
|------------|---------|
| 3♣!        | P/C, 12--14
| 3♦!        | S/T, 18+
| 3M         | NAT, 15--17, 5+#

When RHO bids, X is penalty and usually short in the other major.  We play
Rubinsohl here because we need to bid diamonds.  Please refrain from penalizing
with length in both major suits.  It is usually better to make our own contract
than setting their doubled partscore.

| (2♦)-X-(2M)- | P/C |
|--------------|-----|
| X            | PEN, good 4+# and usually short in the other major
| 2♠!          | P/C
| 2NT!         | TRF, 5+♣
| 3♣!          | TRF, 5+♦
| 3♦!          | TRF, 5+oM
| 3♥!          | P/C, INV in ♥, INV+ in ♠
| 3♠!          | P/C, INV in ♠, FG in ♥

| (2♦)-X-(3M)- | P/C |
|--------------|-----|
| X            | PEN, usuaully short in the other major

After opener shows their major, doubler always penalizes when holding the same
suit.  This action is mostly safe because doubler sits behind the opener.  More
importantly, this treatment creates a negative inference that a pass implies
holding the other major.

- (2♦)-X-(2♠); (3♥)-X = Usually hearts
- (2♦)-X-(2♠); (3♥)-P = Spades!

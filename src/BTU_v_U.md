# BTU vs Unusual

When opponents have bid two suits, optimists take the opportunity of gaining two
cuebids!  The conditions to activate Unusual vs Unusual are as follows:

1. Opponents have shown 5+ 4+ in two known suits.
2. The last bid is by RHO and at most (3â™£).
3. Opponents do not have clubs at (3â™£).  For example:
   - âœ… 1â™ -(3â™£) = â™¥ + â™¦
   - ðŸŸ¥ 1â™¦-(3â™£) = â™  + â™£
   - âœ… 1â™¦-(3â™£) = â™  + â™¥

Then we check what cuebids we have.  Here it is when BTU starts to differ from
Unusual vs Unusual in literature.

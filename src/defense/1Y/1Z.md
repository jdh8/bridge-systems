<div class="warning">

I sometimes relabel suit variables from the main title.

- (1X)-1Y
- (1X)-1Z
- (1Y)-1Z

I use these formulae interchangeably to accommodate a new-coming strain, e.g.

- (1X)-1Y-1Z
- (1X)-1Z-2Y
- (1Y)-1Z-2X

*** High strains

Raises are natural and non-forcing.  Note that the overcall occasionally
contains only 4 cards.  We always raise to the 3-level with 4+ trumps.

Z, a suit higher than Y, is always a major suit.  Bidding 1Z is forcing for
constructiveness. Jump advances in Z are preemptive.

Notrump advances are natural in the sense of showing length or a stopper in the
adverse suit.

(1X)-1Y-
1Z = F, 4+#, usually 8+ HCP
1N = NAT, 9--12 HCP
2Y = CONST, 3+#
2Z = PRE, 6+#
2N = NAT INV, 13--15 HCP
3Y = PRE, 4+#

As 1Z is pretty similar to a direct overcall, aggressor somehow mirrors the
auction but without Rubens advances.  Aggressor does not have a weak hand with
6+# because they would have jumped in the first place.

(1m)-1Y-1M-
1N = NAT, at most 12 HCP
2m = LIM+, 3+ SUPP
2X = NAT, 9--14 points, 4+#
2Y = NAT, 12--14 points, 6+#
2Z = NAT, 12--17 points, 4+#
2M = CONST, 3+#
2N = NAT INV, 13--15 HCP
3m = CONST, 4+ SUPP
3X = NAT, 15--17 points, 4+#
3Y = NAT, 15--17 points, 6+#
3M = PRE, 4+#

*** Low strains

Let's reword the auction as (1Y)-1Z to discuss X, a suit lower than Y. X is
always a minor suit.  We are more interested in 3NT than a minor suit game.
Therefore, we bear the presence of a stopper in mind.  Sometimes we have to bid
a 4-card 2X because we lack a stopper to bid notrump.

Aggressor still has the chance to query a stopper with a cuebid.  That is why we
can bid fairly naturally here.

(1Y)-1Z-
2X = F unless by PH, 9+ HCP, usually 5+#
3X = INV, 6+#

Rebidding to a lower strain is similar to 2/1 or Drury.  Returning to the own
suit is the weakest action.  If advancer has passed, it is also good to pass
with a balanced minimum.

(1Y)-1M-2m-
2Y = F, 12--17 points
2M = MIN, 9--11 points, 5+#
2N = NAT INV, 12--14 HCP
3m = MIN, 9--11 points, usually 4+#
3M = NAT, 15--17 points, 6+#

*** Middle strains

The other suits are Rubens advances.  Cuebids and suits in between are
transfers.  After rephrasing the auction as (1X)-1Z, Y is a suit in between.
There is no distinction between X and Y.  Transfer supports are special
nevertheless.

- *4steps = 2Z − 1*: limit raise or better, 3+ support
- *9steps = 3Z − 1*: mixed raise, 4+ support
- *Other 2XY*: 9+ HCP, usually 5+ cards
- *Other 3XY*: Game try with 6+ cards

Despite that we have skipped the cuebid, aggressor can dissuade further
investigation by simply accepting the transfer.

(1X)-1Z-
4steps = !TRF LIM+, 3+ support
9steps = !TRF CONST, 4+ support
2X = !TRF, 9+ HCP, usually 5+ cards
2Y = !TRF, 9+ HCP, usually 5+ cards
3X = !TRF G/T, 6+ cards
3Y = !TRF G/T, 6+ cards

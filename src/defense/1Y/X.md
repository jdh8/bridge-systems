# (1Y)-X

The takeout double is one of the oldest conventions.  Most players bid naturally
to the double.  However, I suggest transfer advances at 3Y+.  This way, we can
separate paths to suit games by strength and by length.

| (1Y)-X | T/O |
|--------|-----|
| 1Z     | NAT NEG, 0--7, usually 4+#
| 1NT    | CONST, 8--10
| 2X     | NAT NEG, 0--9, usually 4+#
| 2Y!    | <div>RESP.</div><div>INV 4= suit with stopper.</div><div>FG.</div>
| 2Z     | Mild INV, 8--12, 4+#
| 2NT    | INV, 11--12
| 3X     | INV, 10--12, 5+#
| 3YZ!   | TRF INV+, 10+, 5+ next suit
| 3♠!    | Ask for stopper

# Natural (1NT)

*Good, Better, Best* recommends using conventional double over a strong notrump.
We consider a natural notrump opening strong if at least half of the hands
contain 15+ HCP. For instance, 14--16 is considered strong but 13--15 is not.

## Over strong notrump

We play [Woolsey], Multi-Landy with a conventional double, in all seats.

## Over weak notrump

We play plain Landy against a weak notrump.  This simple defense undermines
their *systems on* approach over (1NT)-2♣.  Meanwhile, we still threat to stop
in our natural 2♦.

| (1NT)- | WEAK, usually 12--14 |
|--------|----------------------|
| X      | PEN, 14+
| 2♣!    | UNBAL, 4+♠, 4+♥, usually (54)(xx)

By passed hand, we play the [defense against a strong notrump](#over-strong-notrump).

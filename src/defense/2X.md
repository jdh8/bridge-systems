## Reverse Lebensohl

Though usually treated the same, there is a significant difference between
(2X)-X and 1NT-(2X): we cannot pass boring hands in the former situation!
After a long discussion, we came to a conclusion that reverse Lebensohl with
Rubens advances is a better alternative than transfer or standard counterparts.

As opposed to the standard/original Lebensohl, this 2NT relay handles
constructive hands (8+ HCP or 7+ HCP by passed hand) while directly bidding a
suit below 3X is weak.  Since an in-shape takeout is short in the adverse suit,
advancer is more likely to have a stopper.  Inviting with 2NT right-sides the
contract more often than not.

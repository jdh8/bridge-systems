# Blueberry Cottontail Club

This bidding system is a hybrid between a modernized Blue Club and Larsson's
[Cottontail Club][cotton].  To make 3-card major raises safer, major suit
openings promise 5+ cards or unbalanced 4 cards.

Canapé sometimes happens in this bidding system.  Between a 4-card major and a
longer minor, we open the major suit unlike most natural systems.  On the other
hand, we hide a balanced 4-card major with possibly shorter 1♦.  This system
tries to strike a balance between constructiveness and preemption.  Note that
**canapé does not occur between major suits**.  The opened major suit is no
shorter than the other major suit.  Responder then makes better choice between
major suit games.

Despite of the strong club opening, this system has a strong notrump as suggested
by [Cottontail Club][cotton] and *Good, Better, Best* by Jan Eric Larsson.

# Blueberry Cottontail Club

This bidding system is a hybrid between a modernized Blue Club and Larsson's
[Cottontail Club][cotton].  To make 3-card major raises safer, major suit
openings promise 5+ cards or unbalanced 4 cards.

Despite of the strong club opening, this system has a strong notrump as suggested
by [Cottontail Club][cotton] and *Good, Better, Best* by Jan Eric Larsson.

## The notrump ladder

- **11--13**: 1♦♥♠

- **17--19**: 1♣-1♦; 1NT
- **20--22**: 1♣-1♦; 1♥-1♠; 1NT
- **23--24**: 1♣-1♦; 1♥-1♠; 2NT
- **25+**: 1♣-1♦; 2NT

## Canapé

In contract bridge, canapé stand for bidding a shorter suit first.  This
treatment is common in strong club systems.

- We systematically bid a 4-card major despite of a longer minor in many cases.
- Canapé does not occur between major suits.  This helps choosing between major
  suit games.
- Opener bids 1♦ with 14--15 points, 5=M, and 4+♦.

## Lauria-like Gazzilli

Another recurring pattern in this bidding system is a generalization of
Lorenzo Lauria's Gazzilli.

- Our last two bids are 1M-1NT or 1♥-1♠ (Kaplan interchange), a natural major
  suit followed by a suitless response.
- Rebidding the major suit does not show extra length.  It shows a predefined
  side suit instead (not necessarily clubs).
- A low rebid (1NT or 2♣) becomes a relay:
  - Extra length in the major suit is possible.
  - Extra strength is possible.
  - The relay can be non-forcing because many bids in this system are fairly
    limited.

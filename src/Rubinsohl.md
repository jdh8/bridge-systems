# Rubinsohl

Rubinsohl is a bidding convention aiming for competition at the 2-level.
Originally, for auctions such as 1NT-(2♦♥♠), use 2NT and some steps above to
convey conventional meanings.  I am generalizing onset conditions as follows:

1. Partner has ever bid a non-pass.
2. Moreover, the last non-pass is (2♦♥♠) by either opponent.

If the last non-pass is an artificial call by partner, such as a takeout double,
I recommend [Rumpelsohl](#rumpelsohl) instead.

Similar to Rubens advances, the transfer structure helps saving bidding space.
Showing the suit faster also helps competition.

| *-(2♦)- | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | OPT
| 2M      | NAT NF
| 2NT!    | TRF to 3♣
| 3♣!     | STAY
| 3♦!     | INV+ TRF to 3♥
| 3♥!     | INV+ TRF to 3♠
| 3♠!     | FG TRF to 3NT or 4♣

| *-(2♥)- | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | OPT
| 2♠      | NAT NF
| 2NT!    | TRF to 3♣
| 3♣!     | TRF to 3♦
| 3♦!     | STAY
| 3♥!     | INV+ TRF to 3♠
| 3♠!     | FG TRF to 3NT or 4♣

Swap 3♥♠ against (2♠) like [Larry Cohen][larryco] to avoid declaring hearts.

## Rumpelsohl

Rumpelsohl by Paul van Rijckevorsel was published in The Bridge World, October
1992\.  Traditionally, (2X)-X also start Lebensohl.  However, artificial calls,
even limited ones, are not meant to be passed with boring hands.  I decide to
modify the bidding structure for this subtle difference.

1. The last bid is 2♦♥♠
2. The last non-pass is an artificial call by partner.

In this section, I list (2X)-X as examples.  The meaning of each step varies
with partner's call.  There are several reasons to invite with 2NT.

- Bidding to (2X)-X is not free.
- An invitational X usually lacks a stopper.

Therefore, 2NT includes NF clubs and constructive-invitational hands.

| (2♦)-X- | T/O |
|---------|-----|
| 2M      | NAT NF
| 2NT!    | LEB: 4+♣ or CONST--INV
| 3♣!     | STAY
| 3♦!     | INV+, 5+♥
| 3♥!     | INV+, 5+♠
| 3♠!     | FG, 5+♣

| (2♥)-X- | T/O |
|---------|-----|
| 2♠      | NAT NF
| 2NT!    | LEB: 4+♣ or CONST--INV
| 3♣!     | TRF, 4+♦
| 3♦!     | STAY, 4=♠
| 3♥!     | INV+, 5+♠
| 3♠!     | FG, 5+♣

Again, [Larry Cohen's adjunct][larryco] swaps 3♥♠ over (2♠).

| (2♠)-X- | T/O |
|---------|-----|
| 2NT!    | LEB: 3+♣ or CONST--INV
| 3♣!     | TRF, 4+♦
| 3♦!     | TRF, 4+♥
| 3♥!     | FG, 5+♣
| 3♠!     | FG STAY, 4=♥

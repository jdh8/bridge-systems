# Rubinsohl

Rubinsohl is a bidding convention aiming for competition at the 2-level.
Originally, for auctions such as 1NT-(2♦♥♠), use 2NT and some steps above to
convey conventional meanings.  I am generalizing onset conditions as follows:

1. Partner has ever bid a non-pass.
2. Moreover, the last call is (2♦♥♠) by either opponent.

Similar to Rubens advances, the transfer structure helps saving bidding space.
Showing the suit faster also helps competition.

Note that I don't recommend Rubinsohl to 2(♦♥♠)-X.  The last call is partner's
takeout double.  Rumpelsohl and (reverse) Lebensohl are better options.

| 3♠!     | TRF to 3NT or 4♣

Swap 3♥♠ against (2♠) like [Larry Cohen][larryco] to avoid declaring hearts.

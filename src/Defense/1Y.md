# Natural (1Y)

| (1Y)- | (Quasi-)NAT |
|-------|-------------|
| X!    | T/O, 7.5&minus; NLTC
| 1Z    | 8.5--6.0 NLTC, usually 5+#
| 1NT   | 15--18 HCP, usually BAL 6.5--6.0 NLTC and likely stop
| 2X    | 7.5--6.0 NLTC, 5+#
| 2Z    | PRE, 9.5--8.0 NLTC, usually 6+#
| 2NT!  | UNT, PRE or STR, 5+ 5+ in the lowest two unbid suits
| 3XZ   | PRE, 8.5--8.0 NLTC, usually 7+#
| 3Y!   | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit without stopper
| 3NT!  | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with stopper

## Cuebids

I advocate using cuebids for 5+ 4+ two suiters, except (1♠)-2♠ that forces
playing at the 3-level.  The strength shall be either too weak for an opening
or too strong for a direct overcall.

- **(1♣)-2♣!: Landy**, 5+ 4+ majors or 44(41)
- **(1♦)-2♦!: Flannery**, 4+♠, 5+♥
- **(1♥)-2♥!: Muiderberg**, 5+♠, 4+m
- **(1♠)-2♠!: Michaels**, 5+♥, 5+m

Landy is just [**Ekren 2♣**](../WJ/2C.md) but a forcing overcall.  I suggest
using its continuations.  [**Muiderberg**](../2M-Muiderberg.md) also coincides
an opening convention.  **Michaels** is a special case of **Muiderberg**.  The
only thing we need to discuss here is **Flannery**, deprived of the 2♦ relay
compared to Landy.

Flannery (1♦)-2♦ is close to Flannery 2♦ and the original Ekren 2♦.  I suggest
continuations from [BTU Ekren][btu] + Lebensohl.

| 3♣!      | INV+, 3+♠
| 3♦!      | INV+, 3+♥

## P-P-(1Y)

By passed hand, overcalls that require opening strength (7.5&minus; NLTC) become
one trick weaker.  1NT becomes minor suit oriented takeout.

| P-P-(1Y)- | (Quasi-)NAT |
|-----------|-------------|
| X         | T/O, 8.5&minus; NLTC
| 1NT!      | T/O, 8.5&minus; NLTC, 4+ 4+ in the lowest two unbid suits
| 2X        | 8.5&minus; NLTC, 5+#

## (1Y)-P

Balancing overcalls tend to be intermediate.  Jump overcalls are sound because
there is no one to preempt.  On the other hand, constructive overcalls are light
because partner may have passed a weak notrump.

Unpassed 2NT is no longer unusual because we've got more steps on the notrump
ladder.

- 13--15 HCP: 1NT
- 16--18 HCP: X, then notrump
- 19--21 HCP: 2NT

| (1Y)-P- | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | T/O, 8+ HCP
| 1Z      | 8--15 HCP, 4+#
| 1NT     | 13--15 HCP with stopper
| 2X      | 8--15 HCP, 5+#
| 2Z, 3X  | 11--15 HCP, 6+#
| 2NT     | 19--21 HCP with stopper

<div class="warning">

I sometimes relabel suit variables from the main title.

- (1X) 1Y
- (1X) 1Z
- (1Y) 1Z

I use these formulae interchangeably to accommodate a new-coming strain, e.g.

- (1X) 1Y-1Z
- (1X) 1Z-2Y
- (1Y) 1Z-2X

In competitive bidding, we want more space for raises.  On the other hand,
notrump already shows length or strength in the adverse suit.  The "standard"
and na√Øve approach is to reuse the cuebids for forcing raises.  However, there
are two reasons to use **Rubens advances** AKA **transfer** advances.

There is a debate if new suit advances are forcing or not.  For a suit lower
than Y (say X), forcing is decent.  Aggressor has a cheap cuebid [(1Y) 1Z-2X;
2Y!] to show opening strength, similar to Drury.  Nevertheless, when the auction
goes (1X) 1Z-2Y, opener has a problem to rebid a minimum opening hand without a
stopper:

- 2Z: utterly an underbid
- 2NT: lies about the stopper
- 3Y: an overbid

On the other hand, it is not the most effective to allocate forcing bids at
cuebids.  When we have a fit, we have little interest in exploring side suits.
Space between the forcing raise and Z is unnecessary.  Therefore, it is the most
useful to let Z &minus; 1 transfer to Z.  Consequently, the strains
[[Y .. Z &minus; 1]][interval] map to the suits [[Y + 1 .. Z]][interval].

## Upper strains [Z .. NT]

Upper new suits are always major suits.  Only (1m) 1Y-1M is forcing.  The other
advances are non-forcing because they need little further information.

| (1X) 1Y- | NAT |
|----------|-----|
| 1Z       | F, 4+#, usually 8+
| 1NT      | NAT, 9--12
| 2Y       | CONST, 3+#
| 2Z       | PRE, 6+#
| 2NT      | NAT INV, 13--15
| 3Y       | PRE, 4+#

| (1m) 1Y-1M- | 4+# |
|-------------|-----|
| 1NT         | NAT, --12 HCP
| 2m          | LIM+, 3+ SUPP
| 2X          | NAT, 9--14, usually 4+#
| 2Y          | NAT, 12--14, usually 6+#
| 2Z          | NAT, 12--17, usually 4+#
| 2M          | CONST, 3+#
| 2NT         | NAT INV, 13--15 HCP
| 3m          | CONST, 4+ SUPP
| 3X          | NAT, 15--17, usually 4+#
| 3Y          | NAT, 15--17, usually 6+#
| 3M          | PRE, 4+#

## Transfer advances [Y .. Z &minus; 1]

The middle strains are transfer advances for the [useful space principle][usp].
Z &minus; 1 is home to the forcing raises.

| (1X) 1Z-      | NAT |
|---------------|-----|
| 2XY!          | TRF, usually 9+ HCP and 5+ cards
| 2Z &minus; 1! | TRF LIM+, 3+ SUPP
| 3XY!          | TRF INV+, 6+ cards
| 3Z &minus; 1! | TRF CONST, 4+ SUPP

## Lower new suits (X)

Lower new suits are always minor suits.  Since minor suit games are hard to
make, bidding a new minor suit somehow marks failure to bid a major suit or
notrump.  Aggressor should be aware that the new minor suit might be a
convenient suit to make a forcing advance.

| (1Y) 1Z- | NAT |
|----------|-----|
| 2X       | F unless by PH, 9+ HCP, usually 5+#
| 3X       | INV, 6+#

| (1Y) 1M-2m- | F, usually 5+# |
|-------------|----------------|
| 2Y!         | F, 12--17
| 2M          | MIN, 9--11, 5+#
| 2N          | NAT INV, 12--14 HCP
| 3m          | MIN, 9--11, usually 4+#
| 3Y!         | FG, ask for stopper
| 3M          | NAT, 15--17, usually 6+#

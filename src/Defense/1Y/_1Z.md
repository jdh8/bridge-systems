# (1Y-1Z)

## Also natural 1Z

Both suits are considered adverse.

- RHO's suit is probably forcing.  We can afford showing that suit after an
  initial pass.
- LHO's hearts, especially 5+ cards, is too dangerous to play in.
- It is more useful to cuebid LHO's minor suit than to propose its contract.

# Maggie 2♣

Unlike 1♥-1NT, 1♠-1NT my conceal a heart fit.  Finding a 3-5 fitted 4♥ after
1♠-1NT is pretty challenging.  [Bart] is a convention after forcing 1NT that
tries to tackle heart invitation.  [Lisa], Bart's smarter sister, is an
improvement of Bart.  Maggie, the youngest Simpson, solves this problem at
1♠-2♣ instead.

Given a natural 2/1 bidding system, 1♠-2♣-2♦♥ are underused.  These steps are a
better place for a convention than inside the crowded 1♠-1NT.

Non-forcing sequences only take space up to 2♠.

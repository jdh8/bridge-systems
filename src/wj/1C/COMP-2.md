# Competing at the 2-level

Competition at 1♣-(*) share properties of the following auctions:

- (*)-, as opener shows no suit yet
- 1NT-(*)-, as opener shows only strength

## 1♣-(1NT)-

I recommend a transfer system below 3NT.  Since X frees up 2NT, 2NT and above
become transfers (cf. Rubens advances).  Below 2NT, continuations to
[1NT](../../1NT-&#x42;TU.md) form a major-oriented structure.  Such structure
allows bidding a 5-card major regardless of strength.

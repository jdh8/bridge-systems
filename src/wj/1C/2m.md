# Game-forcing 2♣♦

The positive responses 2♣♦ show a longest suit with 5+ cards.  They are
game-forcing by unpassed hand like 2/1.  This method helps finding minor suit
slams.  I spell out the minor suits because there is a subtle difference between
them. Finding a big fit in clubs is easier because opener can have minimum long
clubs.

Opener reverses with extra values to utilize higher steps to send information.
This avoids an awkward situation Bridge World calls "two temporizers and zero
describers."  Deviating from *Polish Club 2020: Expert*, I define 1♣-2♣♦-2♦♥♠ as
reverses.  This bidding structure separates 15--17 from 12--14 with a 4-card
major.  I believe this treatment helps finding the best contract.  When we only
have a game, we want to play in a major suit despite of a better minor fit.
However, we play the best fit in a slam to maximize our chances, especially at
IMPs.

| 1♣-2♦- | FG, 5+♦ |
|--------|---------|
| 2♥     | S/T, 15+, 4+♥
| 2♠     | S/T, 15+, 4+♠
| 2NT    | Nearly BAL, 12--14 or 18+
| 3♣     | NAT, 12--14 or 18+, 5+♣
| 3♦     | S/T, 15+, usually 5+♦
| 3♥     | S/T, 18+, 6+♥
| 3♠     | S/T, 18+, 6+♠
| 3NT!   | S/T, 15--17, usually 5+♣

I make 1♣-2♦-3NT so because otherwise it would be hard to show these hands.
Grouping 12--14 and 18+ together is usually OK because 18+ can explore slams
unilaterally.

# Positive 1NT, 2♠, and 2NT

I group these suitless positive responses together for simplicity. These
responses deny 4-card majors and 6-card minors.  I also list 1♣-3NT here as
reference because it takes precedence over 1♣-2NT.

| 1♣- | Strength | Distribution |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| 1NT |  8--10   | 2--3♠, 2--3♥, 2--5♦, 2--5♣
| 2♠! | 10--11   | 0--3♠, 0--3♥, 2--5♦, 2--5♣
| 2NT | 12+      | 2--3♠, 2--3♥, 3--4♦, 3--4♣
| 3NT | 12--15   | 33(43)

## 1♣-1NT { #1C-1NT }

I took the artificial 2♦ relay from [FunBridge](https://funbridge.com).  I found
it better than most Polish Club literature.

| 1♣-1NT- | BAL 8--10 |
|---------|-----------|
| 2♣      | S/O, 12--14, 6+♣
| 2♦!     | INV+ (R)
| 2M      | S/T, 18+, 5+#
| 2NT     | INV, 14--15
| 3♣      | S/T, 18+, 6+♣
| 3♦      | S/T, 18+, 6+♦
| 3M      | S/T, 18+, 7+#
| 3NT     | S/O, 16+
| 4♣♦     | S/T, SOL 7+#

| 1♣-1NT-2♦- | INV+ (R) |
|------------|----------|
| 2♥!        | 5--6♣
| 2♠!        | 5--6♦
| 2NT        | MIN, 2--4♦, 2--4♣
| 3♣!        | MAX, 2245
| 3♦!        | MAX, 2254
| 3♥!        | MAX, 6=♣
| 3♠!        | MAX, 6=♦
| 3NT        | MAX, 2--4♦, 2--4♣

## 1♣-2♠! { #1C-2S }

I move unbalanced invitations here from 1♣-1♦.  Opener declares notrump anyway,
so 1♣-2♠ need not be balanced.

| 1♣-2♠- | INV 10--11 |
|--------|------------|
| 2NT    | S/O, 12--13
| 3♣     | S/O, 12--13, 6+♣
| 3♦!    | S/T, 18+, 0--4♠, 0--4♥
| 3M     | S/T, 18+, 5+#
| 3NT    | S/O
| 4♣♦♥♠  | S/T, SOL 7+#

P-1♣-2♠ only contains unbalanced hands of both minors.  Hence, 3♦ becomes a
reasonable signoff.

| P-1♣-2♠- | INV, 4--5♦, 4--5♣ |
|----------|-------------------|
| 3♦       | S/O, 12--13, 4+♦

## 1♣-2NT { #1C-2NT }

Moving balanced game force from 3NT to 2NT was a brilliant idea from
[Polish Club 2005][wj05].  It is difficult to search for a major suit slam after
1♣-3NT.  Therefore, 1♣-3NT is restricted to a flat minimum game force.

I make 1♣-2NT-3NT highly descriptive here to help slam exploration.  This method
makes 3♣♦ inclusive like relays.

| 1♣-2NT- | BAL FG |
|---------|--------|
| 3♣      | 5+♣
| 3♦!     | 0--4♣
| 3M      | S/T, 5+#
| 3NT     | S/T, 15--17, 4414
| 4♣♦♥♠   | S/T, SOL 7+#

P-1♣-2NT simplifies to a balanced invitation, which is in turn similar to
unpassed 1♣-2♠.  I import continuations from 1♣-2♠ as a natural consequence.

| P-1♣-2NT- | BAL INV |
|-----------|---------|
| 3♣        | S/O, 12--13, 6+♣
| 3♦!       | S/T, 18+, 0--4♠, 0--4♥
| 3M        | S/T, 18+, 5+#
| 3NT       | S/O
| 4♣♦♥♠     | S/T, SOL 7+#

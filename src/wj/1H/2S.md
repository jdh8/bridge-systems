# Unbalanced 2♠

The invitational 1♥-2♠ is a multi-way bid.  It has the following variants:

- Unbalanced 3=♥
- 5+ 4+ in minor suits, usually not 22(54)

With a minimum, opener tries to sign off at 3♣♦♥.  Responder can also reevaluate
after opener's rebid.

| 1♥-2♠- | UNBAL 9--11 |
|--------|-------------|
| 2NT    | MIN, 0--3♦, 0--3♣
| 3♣♦    | MIN, 4+#
| 3♥     | MIN, S-SOL 6+♥
| 3♠!    | FG, ask for ♠ stopper

Thanks to this convention, 1♥-1NT becomes more balanced.  Opener can judge more
precisely when to pass.

# Unbalanced 2♠

Like [BTU 1NT-2♠](../1NT/2S.md) but invitational, 1♥-2♠ is a multi-way bid.  It
has the following variants:

- Unbalanced 3=♥
- 6+ minor suit, usually with an unspecified SPL
- 5+ 4+ in minor suits, usually with an unspecified SPL

With a minimum, opener tries to sign off at 3♣♦♥.  Responder can also reevaluate
after opener's rebid.

| 1♥-2♠- | UNBAL 9--11 |
|--------|-------------|
| 2NT!   | MIN P/C, 0--3♦, 0--3♣
| 3♣!    | MIN P/C, 4+♦
| 3♦!    | MIN P/C, 4+♣
| 3♥     | MIN, usually 7+♥
| 3♠!    | FG, ask for ♠ stopper

Thanks to this convention, 1♥-1NT becomes more balanced.  Opener can judge more
precisely when to pass.

# Polish 1♣

This Polish Club has 3 variants:

- 12--14, 2--4♠, 2--4♥, 2--4♦, 2--4♣
- 12--17, 5+♣ or 4414
- 18+, not suitable for 1♦

Note that 2♣ is no longer natural since *Polish Club 2020: Expert*.  1♣ takes
care of all ♣-suited hands.

I move invitational hands out of 1♣-1♦ relay to make it non-forcing.  I believe
this method is more resilient to interference.

| 1♣-  | Quasi-NAT or 18+ |
|------|------------------|
| 1♦!  | NF ART NEG, 0--9
| 1♥   | F, 7+, 4+♥
| 1♠   | F, 7+, 4+♠
| 1NT  | BAL CONST, 8--10, 2--3♠, 2--3♥, 2--5♦, 2--5♣
| 2♣   | FG, 5+♣
| 2♦   | FG, 5+♦
| 2♥!  | P/C, 7--9, 4+♥, 5+♠
| 2♠!  | INV, 10--11, 0--3♠, 0--3♥, 2--5♦, 2--5♣
| 2NT! | FG, 2--3♠, 2--3♥, 3--4♦, 3--4♣
| 3♣   | INV, 9--11, 6+♣
| 3♦   | INV, 9--11, 6+♦
| 3M   | PRE, 3--6, 7+#
| 3NT  | 12--15, 33(43)
| 4♣!  | PRE, S-SOL 8+M, 0--1 outside A/K
| 4♦!  | PRE, SOL 8+M, no outside A/K
| 4M   | PRE, 8+#

1♣-3♣♦ and 1♣-3M look unrelated, yet they serve the same purpose: move the
best single suiters out of 1♣-1♦.

## P-1♣ { #P-1C }

Game-forcing responses simplify to corresponding invitations.

| P-1♣- | Quasi-NAT or 18+ |
|-------|------------------|
| 2♣    | INV, 5+♣, 0--3♠, 0--3♥
| 2♦    | INV, 5+♦, 0--3♠, 0--3♥
| 2♠!   | UNBAL INV, 0--3♠, 0--3♥, 4--5♦, 4--5♣
| 2NT   | BAL INV, 2--3♠, 2--3♥, 2--5♦, 2--5♣

## Competing at the 1-level

The design of the responses already bears competitive bidding in mind.  We
somehow ignore the meaning of overcalls to deal with artificial and psychic
bids.  We reorder major suit bids with Transfer Walsh to get a "support double"
by accepting the transfer.

We treat 1♣ as a weak notrump more than a club opening.  Club support is not
very effective.  We have a transfer scheme for all levels below 3NT.

- **1♦♥♠**: Transfer to the next strain. The low-level cuebid of 1♠ lets opener
  declare notrump.
- **From 2Q to 3♥**: A weak or strong transfer of 6+ cards.
- **3♠**: Transfer Gambling 3NT.

Natural 1NT is not very useful after a double.  We rebrand it as transfer.

| 1♣-(X)- | - |
|---------|---|
| XX      | NF BAL G/T, 10+
| 1♦!     | TRF, 7+, 4+♥
| 1♥!     | TRF, 7+, 4+♠
| 1♠!     | TRF, 7+, 5+♣
| 1NT!    | TRF, 7+, 5+♦

| 3♦!     | TRF, PRE 7+♥ or FG 6+♥
| 3♥!     | TRF, PRE 7+♠ or FG 6+♠
| 3♠!     | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with no stopper outside
| 3NT!    | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with one stopper outside

When RHO bids a suit, natural notrump from [Polish Club 2005][wj05] right-sides
the contract.

| 1♣-(1Y)- | - |
|----------|---|
| X!       | TRF, 7+, 4+ next suit
| 1♥!      | TRF, 7+, 4+♠
| 1♠!      | TRF to 1NT, 7+
| 1NT      | BAL INV, 9–11, 2–3♠, 2–3♥, 2–5♦, 2–5♣
| 2X       | INV+, 10+, 5+#
| 2YZ!     | TRF, PRE or INV+, 6+ next suit
| 2♠!      | TRF, PRE 7+♣ or FG 6+♣
| 2NT      | FG with stopper
| 3♣!      | TRF, PRE 7+♦ or FG 6+♦
| 3♦!      | TRF, PRE 7+♥ or FG 6+♥
| 3♥!      | TRF, PRE 7+♠ or FG 6+♠
| 3♠!      | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit without stopper
| 3NT!     | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with stopper

Of course 1♣-(1♠)-X is a negative double.  Therefore, 2♥ becomes negative free
bid.  This modern adjunct finds more marginal 4♥ and puts pressure on the
opponents by threatening to play 2♥.

| 1♣-(1♠)- | - |
|----------|---|
| X!       | TRF, 7+, 4+♥
| 2♥       | NF, 7--11, 5+♥

### Balancing

Responder is strictly limited, and 1♣ is prone to psychic bids.  Therefore,
there are some quirks about cuebids:

- Responder's cuebid (not to a X) is natural.
- Opener's cuebid after X is natural.

| 1♣-(1Y)-P- | - |
|------------|---|
| P          | 12--17
| X!         | 12--20, T/O.  21+, PEN
| 1Z         | 15--20, 4+#
| 1NT        | 18--20, usually likely stop
| 2♣         | 12--17, 5+♣
| 2Y!        | 21+, ask for stopper
| 2Z         | 20--23, 5+#
| 2NT        | 21--23 with stopper

As the 1♦ opening takes care of some strong diamond hands, rebidding 2♦ here is
not very useful.  Reverse transfer to clubs seems better.

| 1♣-(1♥)-P- | - |
|------------|---|
| 2♦!        | 18--20, 5+♣

| 1♣-(1♠)-P- | - |
|------------|---|
| 2♦!        | 18--20, 5+♣
| 2♥         | 20--23, 5+♥

### Transfer Walsh

Transfer to major suits has the same meaning as major suit responses to 1♣.
Opener usually bids as if responder had bid the suit naturally.  However, opener
has a new option: accept the transfer at 1M.  This option *steals* the support
double when advancer passes.

Here I only list support rebids for brevity.  The complete set of responses is
at [1♣-1M](1C/1M.md).

| 1♣-(1♦)-X- | 7+, 4+♥ |
|------------|---------|
| 1♥         | SUPP, 12--17, 3=♥
| 2♦!        | FG, 3+♥
| 2♥         | MIN, 12--14, 4=♥
| 3♥         | INV, 15--17, 4+♥

| <div>1♣-(1♦)-1♥-</div><div>1♣-(1♥)-X-</div> | 7+, 4+♠ |
|:----|-------------------|
| 1♠  | SUPP, 12--17, 3=♠ |
| 2♦! | FG, 3+♠           |
| 2♠  | MIN, 12--14, 4=♠  |
| 3♠  | INV, 15--17, 4+♠  |

The cuebid is a useful tool to ask for stopper by ceding notrump declaration. I
decide to have a dual meaning 2♥, similar to 4SF.  It asks for a stopper by
default.  Rebidding the suit shows a natural suit.

| 1♣-(1♥)-X- | 7+, 4+♠ |
|------------|---------|
| 2♥!        | INV+, ask for stopper.  FG, 5+♥
| 3♥!        | FG, 5+♦, 5+♣

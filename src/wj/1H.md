# Natural 1♥

The major suit openings show 12--17 points and 5+ cards.  I separate them into
two chapters due to subtle differences in their continuations.

Responses to 1♥ are similar to natural 2/1 along with reverse Bergen raises.

| 1♥-  | 12--17, 5+♥ |
|------|-------------|
| 1♠   | F, 4+♠
| 1NT  | NF, usually 7--11, 0--3♠, 0--3♥
| 2♣♦  | NAT FG
| 2♥   | CONST, 3+♥
| 2♠!  | UNBAL INV, 9--11: 3=♥ or 5+ 4+ in minors
| 2NT! | FG, 4+♥
| 3♣!  | INV, 4+♥
| 3♦!  | CONST, 4+♥
| 3♥!  | PRE, 4+♥
| 3♠!  | FG SPL, 0--1♠, 4+♥
| 3NT! | Choice of games, 12--15, 33(43)
| 4♣!  | FG SPL, 0--1♣, 4+♥
| 4♦!  | FG SPL, 0--1♦, 4+♥
| 4♥!  | PRE, UNBAL 4+♥

## P-1♥

P-1♥ reduces to a fairly natural system.  We can keep using [Stenberg
2NT](1H/2NT.md) because it assigns minimum hands to 3♣.

| P-1♥- | 12--17, 5+♥ |
|-------|-------------|
| 2♣♦   | INV, 5+#
| 2♠!   | UNBAL INV, 3=♥
| 2NT!  | INV, 4+♥
| 3♣♦!  | INV, 5+#, 4+♥
| 3♥!   | CONST, 4+♥

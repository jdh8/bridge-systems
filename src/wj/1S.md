# Natural 1♠

The major suit openings show 12--17 points and 5+ cards.  I separate them into
two chapters due to subtle differences in their continuations.

- Unpassed 1♠-1NT is forcing.
- Maggie 1♠-2♣ is either a natural game force or a heart invitation.
- I recommend Monolo raises instead of Bergen raises.  Preemptive raise is not
  that useful since spades rank as the highest suit.  Monolo was a bidding
  system developed by Fei Chen (Doizi).  Monolo raises pack mini-SPL in
  3♣♦, leaving mixed+ raises at 3♥♠.

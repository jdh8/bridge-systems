# Natural 1♠

The major suit openings show 12--17 points and 5+ cards.  I separate them into
two chapters due to subtle differences in their continuations.

- Unpassed 1♠-1NT is forcing.
- Maggie 1♠-2♣ is either a natural game force or a heart invitation.
- I recommend Monolo raises instead of Bergen raises.  Preemptive raise is not
  that useful since spades rank as the highest suit.  Monolo was a bidding
  system developed by Fei Chen (Doizi).  Monolo raises pack mini-SPL in
  3♣♦, leaving mixed+ raises at 3♥♠.

| 1♠-  | 12--17, 5+♠ |
|------|-------------|
| 1NT  | F, usually 7--11, 0--3♠
| 2♣!  | NAT FG or INV 5--6♥
| 2♦   | FG, 4+♦
| 2♥   | FG, 5+♥
| 2♠   | CONST, 3+♠
| 2NT! | FG, 4+♠
| 3♣!  | INV or S/T, 4+♠, SPL ♦ or ♥
| 3♦!  | INV or S/T, 4+♠, SPL ♣
| 3♥!  | INV or S/T, 4+♠
| 3♠!  | CONST, 4+♠
| 3NT! | Choice of games, 12--15, 33(43)
| 4X!  | FG SPL, 0--1#, 4+♠
| 4♠   | PRE, UNBAL 4+♠

## Responding with 5+ hearts

- **Game-forcing**: 2♥
- **Strong invitational 6+ hearts**: 1NT and then 3♥
- **Invitational**: 2♣
- **Constructive**: 1NT and then 2♥

## P-1♠

P-1♠ reduces to a fairly natural system.  We can keep using [Stenberg
2NT](1S/2NT.md) because it assigns minimum hands to 3♣.

| P-1♠- | 12--17, 5+♠ |
|-------|-------------|
| 1NT   | NF, usually 7--11, 0--3♠
| 2♣♦♥  | INV, 5+#
| 2NT!  | INV, 4+♠
| 3♣♦!  | INV, 5+#, 4+♠
| 3♥    | STR INV, 6+#

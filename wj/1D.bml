* The 1!d opening

This opening shows 4+ diamonds and usually 5+.  It gets more unbalanced as the
point count increases.

- 12--14 HCP: 5+!d or 4!d(441)
- 15--17 HCP: UNBAL, 5+!d or 4!d(441)
- 18--20 HCP: UNBAL, 5+!d, 0--3!s, 0--3!h

** The 1M responses

Opener rebids fairly naturally.  As suggested by /Polish Club 2020: Expert,/ we
overload the reverse in the other major for a 3-card fit reverse.  I find this
method better than fit reverse at the 3-level due to 3451 hands.  We cannot exclude 3=!s from 1!d-1!s-2!h anyway.

*** BTU 3-way checkback

We use BTU-style 3-way checkback to an XYZ auction.  There are 3 artificial
relays in the 3-way checkback:

- *2!c*: ...
- *2!d*: game-forcing checkback, usually a choice of games
- *2NT*: transfer to clubs

The variants in 2!c are as follows:

- To play 2X
- Strongly shaped invitation
- Balanced invitation or choice of games

As a corollary, natural 2X are wide-range invitations and 3X become slam tries.

** The game-forcing 2!c

The 2!c response is considered 2/1 FG in this bidding system.  It either is
natural or conceals a fit in diamonds.

** Competitive bidding

Our competitive bidding structure is similar to the 1!c opening.

We still have the transfer structure after 1!d-(1M).  It is not as obvious as
1!c-(1X) though.

* Polish 1!c

** The 1!d relay

In our version of Polish Club, the 1!d relay denies invitational values.  This
relay contains weak hands without another suitable bid.

We swap the 2!d and 2NT responses for better constructiveness by courtesy of
Ting-Yu Ye (TpKotoba).

The bidding structure at 1!c-1!d-1NT is similar to the 1NT opening.

3C = NF, 7--9 HCP, 4+!c
3D = NF, 7--9 HCP, 7+!d

The 2!d rebid shows a nearly balanced hand with 21--23 HCP.  If you can force
to game, bid as if partner opened a natural 2NT.  Otherwise, try to sign off at
the 2-level.

** Positive 1M responses

Opener's 2!d rebid is Odwrotka, a fit reverse showing a game-forcing 3+ card
support.  The jump reverse of the other major shows a game-forcing minor two
suiter to alleviate the burden on 2NT.

*** BTU 3-way checkback

We use BTU-style 3-way checkback to an XYZ auction.  There are 3 artificial
relays in the 3-way checkback:

- *2!c*: ...
- *2!d*: game-forcing checkback, usually a choice of games
- *2NT*: transfer to clubs

The variants in 2!c are as follows:

- To play 2X
- Strongly shaped invitation
- Balanced invitation or choice of games

As a corollary, natural 2X are wide-range invitations and 3X become slam tries.

After the BTU checkback of 1!c-1!h-1!s-2!c, we need to bid game-forcing clubs at

*** Odwrotka with the strong 2!h relay

We use the relay structure in /Polish Club 2020: Expert./  The 2!h response to
Odwrotka is a slam try with 11+ HCP or a certain fit and <= 8.0 NLTC.  The
relay structure generally lets the strong opener declare notrump. 

1C-1M-2D-
2H = !S/T (R), ~11+ HCP
  2S = !Default (R)
  2N = Probably (4333)
2S = !NEG, 7--10 HCP, 4=M
  2N = !Ask for a side suit, a 5-card minor or the other 4-card major
2N = !MIN, 7--10 HCP, 5=M, not BAL
  3C = !Ask for the side suit
3C = !Mild S/T, 9--11 HCP, 5+!c, 4=M

4D = !SPL, 7--10 HCP, 0--1!d, 6+M

Relay systems can be cryptic!  I am summing up why we arrange the steps in this
way.

- *2!h*: The lowest step layers *strong hands.*  We can repeat the whole
  structure inside.  This step follows the logic of (reverse) Lebensohl.
- *2!s*: The second step holds the possibility of a misfit, *4 cards.*  We
  need space to explore games in the other strains.
- *2NT*: *Unbalanced fit!*  Opener never settles in 3NT.  Feel free to bid
  notrump.
- *3M*: *Balanced fit!*  Give opener a chance to declare 3NT with a flat hand.
- *3m*: Take some hands out of the nebulous 2!s.  These hands suggests a 
  *minor suit* slam.
- *Others*: These Splinter-level steps are made for *big fits.*

1C-1M-2D-2H-2S-
2N = 4=M
  3C = !Ask for a side suit
    3M = !TRF, 4+!c
    3N = 4M(333)
3C = 4+!c, 5=M
3D = 4+!d, 5=M
3oM = 4+#, 5=M
3M = !ART, BAL 5=M
3N = !ART, 6+M
4C = !SPL, 0--1!c, 6+M
4D = !SPL, 0--1!d, 6+M

** Balanced positive responses

Balanced positive responses are pretty descriptive.  Opener can rebid
fairly naturally.

1C-1N-
2C = INV, 15--17 HCP, 5+!c
2D = FG, 18+ HCP, 5+!d
2H = FG, 18+ HCP, 5+!h

2N = INV, 15--17 HCP, (441)4
3C = FG, 18+ HCP, 5+!c
3D = !FG SPL, 0--1!d

3S = !FG SPL, 0--1!s

1C-2N-
3C = 15+ HCP, 4+!c
3D = 18+ HCP, 5+!d
3H = 18+ HCP, 5+!h
3S = 18+ HCP, 5+!s

** Game-forcing 2m responses

Like over 2/1 responses, opener jumps with extra values to utilize higher steps
to send information.  This avoids an awkward situation Bridge World calls “two
temporizers and zero describers.”

1C-2C-
2D = !S/T (R), 15+ HCP, usually 5+!c
2H = S/T, 15+ HCP, 4+!h

3D = S/T, 18+ HCP, 6+!d
3H = S/T, 18+ HCP, 6+!h
3S = S/T, 18+ HCP, 6+!s
3N = NAT, 12--14 HCP, 3343

1C-2D-
2H = S/T, 15+ HCP, 4+!h
2S = S/T, 15+ HCP, 4+!s
2N = Nearly BAL, 12--14 or 18+ HCP
3C = NAT, 12--14 or 18+ HCP, 5+!c

3H = S/T, 18+ HCP, 6+!h
3S = S/T, 18+ HCP, 6+!s
3N = S/T, 15--17 HCP, 5+!c

** Competitive bidding

The design of the responses already bears competitive bidding in mind.  We
somehow ignore the meaning of overcalls to deal with artificial and psychic
bids.  We reorder major suit bids with Transfer Walsh to get a “support
double” by accepting the transfer.

Natural notrump is not very useful after a double.  We rebrand it as transfer.

1C-(D)-
R  = NF BAL G/T, 10+ HCP
1D = !TRF, 7+ HCP, 4+!h
  1H = MIN, 12--14 HCP, 3=!h
1H = !TRF, 7+ HCP, 4+!s
  1S = MIN, 12--14 HCP, 3=!s
1S = !TRF, 7+ HCP, 5+!c
1N = !TRF, 7+ HCP, 5+!d
2C = PRE, 3--9 HCP, 6+!c

3C = !TRF, PRE 7+!d or FG 6+!d
3D = !TRF, PRE 7+!h or FG 6+!h
3H = !TRF, PRE 7+!s or FG 6+!s
3S = !Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with no stopper outside
3N = !Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with one stopper outside

Negative free bid of hearts works well with the negative double of 1!c-(1!s)-X.
Otherwise, we employ standard forcing free bids for minor suits.

1C-(1S)-
D  = !NEG, 7+ HCP, 4+!h
2H = NF, 7--11 HCP, 5+!h

We treat 1!c as a weak noturmp more than a club opening.  Club support is not
very effective. We have a transfer scheme for all levels below 3NT.

- *1!d!h!s*: Transfer to the next strain.  The low-level /cuebid/ of 1!s lets 
  opener declare notrump.
- *From 2Q to 3!h* (skipping 2NT): A weak or strong transfer of 6+ cards.
- *3!s*: Transfer Gambling 3NT.
